/*
 *=========================================================
 *				DAB Fill Tree Test
 * This test fills small binary trees of fixed depth with
 * words from the the RNG.  When a word cannot be inserted
 * into the tree, the current count of words in the tree is
 * recorded, along with the position at which the word
 * would have been inserted.
 *
 * The words from the RNG are rotated (in long cycles) to
 * better detect RNGs that may bias only the high, middle,
 * or low bytes.
 *
 * The test returns two p-values.  The first is a Pearson
 * chi-sq test against the expected values (which were
 * estimated empirically).  The second is a Pearson chi-sq
 * test for a uniform distribution of the positions at
 * which the insert failed.
 *
 * Because of the target data for the first p-value,
 * ntuple must be kept at the default (32).
