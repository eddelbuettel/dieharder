 *                 DAB DCT (Frequency Analysis) Test
 *
 * This test performs a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) on the output of
 * the RNG. More specifically, it performs tsamples transforms, each over
 * an independent block of ntuple words. If tsamples is large enough, the
 * positions of the maximum (absolute) value in each transform are
 * recorded and subjected to a chisq test for uniformity/independence. [1]
 * (A standard type II DCT is used.)
 * 
 * If tsamples is smaller than or equal to 5 times ntuple then a fallback
 * test will be used, whereby all DCT values are converted to p-values
 * and tested for uniformity via a KS test. This version is significantly
 * less sensitive, and is not recommended.
 *
 * Power: With the right parameters, this test catches more GSL
 * generators than any other; however, that count is biased by each of
 * the randomNNN generators having three copies.
 *
 * Limitations: ntuple is required to be a power of 2, because a radix 2
 * algorithm is used to calculate the DCT.
 *
 * False positives: targets are (mostly) calculated exactly, however it
 * will still return false positives when ntuple is small and tsamples is
 * very large. For the default ntuple value of 256, I get bad scores with
 * about 100 million or more tsamples (psamples set to 1).
 *
 * [1] The samples are taken as unsigned integers, and the DC coefficient
 * is adjusted to compensate for this.

/*
 * Discrete Cosine Transform (frequency or energy compaction) test.
 * So, it is easy to say that we want to do a DCT of the data as a test. But,
 * after we take a DCT, then what?
 * I tested a number of different methods for generating a p value from the
 * DCT.  I was actually quite surprised at the method that worked the best...
 * First off, the output of the DCT should be random-looking, normally
 * distributed with a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1, after some
 * adjustments. (The first element requires different adjustments than the
 * rest.) The adjustments are trivial to calculate.
 * There are t-sample DCTs taken; each DCT is on ntuple values.
 * 1. Generate a p value for every DCT value (t-sample * nutple of them),
 *    and run a single kstest on them all.
 *   -- Worked second best; surprisngly slow for some parameters.
 * 2. Find the single worst DCT value, generate a p-value, and compensate.
 *  -- Generally less powerful than #1. the only exception was generator #20.
 * 3. Sum each DCT vector, producing a result of length ntuple.
 *   A. Generate a p value for each sum, run ks test on them.
 *  -- Weaker than #2 even.
 *   B. Find the single worst sum, generate a p-value, and compensate.
 *  -- Also weaker than #2.
 * 4. Find the position of the most extreme value in each DCT. Run a chisq
 *    on the vector of counts of how many times each position was the most
 *    extreme.  Requires t-samples to be > 5*ntuple.
 *  -- The best! Amazingly, fails the ENTIRE random* family for the right
 *     parameters!! (Also, seems to avoid some false positives I was
 *     getting from #1.)
 *
 * On the current false positives: for the primary method the false
 * positives occur because the first and (ntuple/2)+1'th samples are the
 * largest too often (and about as often as each other).
