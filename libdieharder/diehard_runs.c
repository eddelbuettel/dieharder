 *========================================================================
 * This is the Diehard Runs test, rewritten from the description
 * in tests.txt on George Marsaglia's diehard site.
 *
 * Here is the test description from diehard_tests.txt:
 *
 * This is the RUNS test. It counts runs up, and runs down,in a sequence
 * of uniform [0,1) variables, obtained by floating the 32-bit integers
 * in the specified file. This example shows how runs are counted:
 *  .123, .357, .789, .425,. 224, .416, .95
 * contains an up-run of length 3, a down-run of length 2 and an up-run
 * of (at least) 2, depending on the next values.  The covariance matrices
 * for the runs-up and runs-down are well-known, leading to chisquare tests
 * for quadratic forms in the weak inverses of the covariance matrices.
 * Runs are counted for sequences of length 10,000.  This is done ten times,
 * then repeated.
 *
 *                            Comment
 *
 * I modify this the following ways. First, I let the sequence length be
 * the variable -t (vector length) instead of fixing it at 10,000.  This
 * lets one test sequences that are much longer (entirely possible with
 * a modern CPU even for a fairly slow RNG).  Second, I repeat this for
 * the variable -s (samples) times, default 100 and not just 10.  Third,
 * because RNG's often have "bad seeds" for which they misbehave, the
 * individual sequences can be optionally -i reseeded for each sample.
 * Because this CAN let bad behavior be averaged out to where
 * it isn't apparent for many samples with few bad seeds, we may need to
 * plot the actual distribution of p-values for this and other tests where
 * this option is used.  Fourth, it is silly to convert integers into floats
 * in order to do this test.  Up sequences in integers are down sequences in
 * floats once one divides by the largest integer available to the generator,
 * period. Integer arithmetic is much faster than float AND one skips the
 * very costly division associated with conversion.
