 * This should be the only tool we use to access bit substrings
 * from now on.  Note that we write our own bitstring access tools
 * instead of using ldap's LBER (Basic Encoding Rules) library call
 * to both retain control and because it would introduce a slightly
 * exotic dependency in the resulting application.
 *
 * bstring is a pointer to the uint string to be parsed.  It is a uint
 * pointer to make it easy to pass arbitrary strings which will generally
 * be e.g. unsigned ints in dieharder but might be other data types
 * in other applications (might as well make this semi-portable while I'm
 * writing it at all).  bslen is the length of bitstring in uints.  blen is
 * the length of the bitstring to be returned (as an unsigned int) and has
 * to be less than the length, in bits, of bitstring.  Finally, boffset
 * is the bit index of the point in the bitstring from which the result
 * will be returned.
 *
 * The only other thing that has to be defined is the direction from which
 * the bit offset and bit length are counted.  We will make the
 * LEAST significant bit offset 0, and take the string from the direction
 * of increasing signicance.  Examples:
 *
 *   bitstring:  10010110, length 1 (byte, char).
 * for offset 0, length 4 this should return: 0110
 *     offset 1, length 4: 1011
 *     offset 5, length 4: 0100 (note periodic wraparound)
 *     offset 6, length 4: 1010 (ditto)
 *
 * where of course the strings are actually returned as e.g.
 *     00000000000000000000000000000110  (unsigned int).
